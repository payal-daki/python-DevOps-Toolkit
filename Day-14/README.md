# Day 14: Python For DevOps - Automate JIRA Creation on a Github Event using Python

Welcome to Day 14 of Python For DevOps! In this project, we will automate the process of creating a JIRA issue whenever a specific event occurs on a GitHub repository using Python. This project combines the power of Python, GitHub's webhooks, and the JIRA API to streamline your development workflow.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance collaboration between development teams by automatically creating a JIRA issue when a specific event, such as a new pull request or issue creation, occurs on a GitHub repository. This automation reduces manual effort and ensures that all relevant information is seamlessly integrated into your project management system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- GitHub Webhooks
- JIRA API

## Features
- Listen for GitHub webhook events using Python
- Extract relevant data from the GitHub event payload
- Authenticate and interact with the JIRA API to create a new issue
- Automate the process of creating JIRA issues based on GitHub events

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up GitHub webhook for the desired repository
4. Obtain JIRA API credentials and configure authentication
5. Start the Python script: `python main.py`

## Usage
1. Configure the GitHub webhook to send events to your Python script
2. Monitor incoming webhook events using Python
3. Extract relevant data from the event payload
4. Authenticate with the JIRA API using your credentials
5. Create a new JIRA issue programmatically based on the GitHub event data

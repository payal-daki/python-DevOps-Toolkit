## File Operations in Python

File operations in Python are fundamental for DevOps automation. They involve tasks such as reading, writing, and updating files. Python provides built-in functions like `open()` for efficient file handling.

### Theory:

File operations are crucial for DevOps engineers to automate tasks related to server configuration. Understanding concepts like 'r' (read) and 'w' (write) modes helps in manipulating files effectively for automation purposes.

### Practical Example:

To demonstrate file operations, we can create a Python script that reads a server configuration file, checks for a specific parameter (e.g., maximum connections), and updates its value based on certain conditions.

## Configuring Server using Python

Automating server configuration updates with Python involves:
1. Reading the existing configuration file.
2. Identifying the parameter to be updated (e.g., maximum connections).
3. Implementing a script that automatically updates the parameter when certain conditions are met.

### Practical Example:

A Python script can be written to monitor server metrics and adjust configuration settings dynamically. For instance, the script can check the current number of connections on a server and update the configuration file to optimize performance when a threshold is reached.

By combining theory with practical examples, this repository aims to showcase the power of Python in automating server configuration tasks for DevOps efficiency. üöÄüîß

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in Python.

### Examples

```python
# Addition
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b  # c is 8

# Subtraction
d = a - b  # d is 2

# Multiplication
e = a * b  # e is 15

# Division
f = a / b  # f is 1.6667

# Floor Division
g = a // b  # g is 1

# Modulus
h = a % b   # h is 2 (remainder of 5 / 3)
```

---

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

### Examples

```python
# Basic assignment
x = 10

# Addition assignment
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
```

---

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

### Examples

```python
# AND operator
a = True
b = False
result = a and b  # result is False

# OR operator
result = a or b   # result is True

# NOT operator
result = not a     # result is False
```

---

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare values.

### Examples

```python
# Greater than
x = 5
y = 3
result = x > y   # result is True

# Less than
result = x < y   # result is False

# Equal to
result = x == y  # result is False

# Not equal to
result = x != y  # result is True
```

---

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

### Examples

```python
# Identity (is)
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
result = a is b   # result is False

# Non-identity (is not)
result = a is not b  # result is True
```

---

## Bitwise Operators (Brief Mention)

Bitwise operators are used to manipulate bits in integers.

### Examples

```python
# Bitwise AND
a = 5
b = 3
result = a & b

# Bitwise OR
result = a | b

# Bitwise XOR
result = a ^ b
```

---

## Membership Operators (Brief Mention)

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is present in an object.

### Example

```python
# in operator
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 3 in list   # result is True

# not in operator
result = 6 not in list   # result is True
```

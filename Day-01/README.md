# Day 1: Introduction to Python

Welcome to Day 1 of learning Python

## üêç Introduction

In this session, we introduce Python, compare it with shell scripting, and get Python installed on your system.

### üìã Prerequisites

- Have a system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) with internet access.
- Basic understanding of using a terminal or command prompt.

### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Python installed:

1. **Windows Installation**:
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
   - Use Git Bash or Command Prompt for smooth installation.

2. **Mac/Linux Installation**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - For Mac, use Homebrew: `brew install python`.
   - For Linux, use your package manager: `sudo apt-get install python3`.

3. **Using Code Spaces**:
   - If facing issues, consider using Visual Studio Code's Code Spaces for an easy setup.

### üîÑ Shell Scripting vs Python

- **Flexibility**: Python offers more powerful data handling and manipulation capabilities compared to shell scripts.
- **Portability**: Shell scripts are typically more portable across different Unix-like systems without additional dependencies.
- **Syntax**: Python's syntax is more readable and allows for complex logic and algorithms.

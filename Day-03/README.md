Welcome to Day 3 of Python for DevOps! In today's class, we delve into essential concepts like keywords, variables, and best practices. Let's explore the key takeaways and dive into Python fundamentals.

## Keywords 🚀

### List of Python Keywords

1. **and**: A logical operator used to combine conditional statements.
2. **as**: Used to create an alias when importing a module.
3. **assert**: Used for debugging purposes to assert the truth of a condition.
4. **break**: Terminates the current loop statement and resumes execution at the next statement.
5. **class**: Used to define a new class in Python.
6. **continue**: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.
7. **def**: Defines a function.
8. **del**: Deletes an object.
9. **elif**: Used in conditional statements as an alternative to if.
10. **else**: Executes a block of code if the conditional statement is false.
11. **except**: Catches exceptions raised by try block code.
12. **finally**: Executes code regardless of the try-except block outcome.
13. **for**: Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary, string).
14. **from**: Used to import specific attributes or functions from a module.
15. **global**: Declares a global variable.
16. **if**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
17. **import**: Imports a module into the current namespace.
18. **in**: Checks if a value exists in a sequence.
19. **is**: Checks if two variables refer to the same object.
20. **lambda**: Creates an anonymous function.
21. **nonlocal**: Declares a variable in the enclosing scope.
22. **not**: A logical operator that reverses the logical state of its operand.
23. **or**: A logical operator used to combine conditional statements.
24. **pass**: Used as a placeholder where code is syntactically required but no action is needed.
25. **raise**: Raises an exception.
26. **return**: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
27. **try**: Executes a block of code and handles exceptions.
28. **while**: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
29. **with**: Simplifies exception handling by ensuring cleanup code is executed.
30. **yield**: Pauses and resumes the execution of a generator function.

Each keyword serves a specific purpose in Python programming, from defining control flow to managing scope and exceptions. Understanding these keywords is fundamental to mastering Python development.

## Variables: Global vs Local 🌐

  🌟 Variables in Python can be global or local in scope.
  🔍 Global variables are accessible throughout the program, whereas local variables are limited to their defined scope, typically within a function.
  🌐 Understanding variable scope is crucial for efficient and error-free Python programming.

## Naming Conventions 🐍

🏷️ Use descriptive names for variables to enhance readability and maintainability.
📛 Follow naming conventions like snake_case or CamelCase for multi-word variable names.
🎯 Good naming conventions improve code clarity and signal professionalism to others reviewing your code.

## GitHub Interactive Practice 🚀

👩‍💻 Now, let's reinforce what we've learned:
- **Task 1:** Create a Python script using global and local variables.
- **Task 2:** Identify and explain at least 5 Python keywords in your script.
- **Task 3:** Use proper naming conventions for your variables and functions.

Feel free to expand on these tasks and experiment further with Python!

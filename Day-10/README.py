# 📚 Day-10: Real-Time Example of List Operations and Exception Handling in Python

Welcome to Day-10 of our Python tutorial series! 🎉 Today, we will cover **list operations** and **exception handling** with a real-time example. This guide will be interactive and fun, so let's dive in! 🚀

## 📝 Introduction to Lists

A list in Python is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Lists allow duplicate elements. They are one of the most versatile data types in Python.

```python
# Example of a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)
```

## 🔄 List Operations

Let's explore some common list operations:

- **Adding elements**: `append()`, `insert()`
- **Removing elements**: `remove()`, `pop()`
- **Accessing elements**: Indexing, Slicing
- **Other operations**: `len()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`

### Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Add an element
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Remove an element
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Access an element
print(fruits[1])  # 'cherry'

# Sort the list
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

## 💡 Real-Time Example

Imagine we have a list of student names and we need to perform various operations like adding a new student, removing a student, and finding the position of a student in the list.

```python
students = ["John", "Jane", "Tom", "Alice"]

# Adding a new student
students.append("Bob")
print(students)  # ['John', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'Alice', 'Bob']

# Removing a student
students.remove("Tom")
print(students)  # ['John', 'Jane', 'Alice', 'Bob']

# Finding the position of a student
index = students.index("Alice")
print(f"Alice is at position {index + 1}")  # Alice is at position 3
```

## ⚠️ Exception Handling

In Python, exceptions are errors detected during execution. We can handle these exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

### Example:
```python
try:
    # Some code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always execute.")
```

## 🛠 Combining List Operations and Exception Handling

Let's create a real-time example where we combine list operations and exception handling. We'll handle cases where a student we're trying to remove isn't in the list.

```python
students = ["John", "Jane", "Tom", "Alice"]

# Function to remove a student with exception handling
def remove_student(student_name):
    try:
        students.remove(student_name)
        print(f"{student_name} has been removed.")
    except ValueError:
        print(f"{student_name} is not in the list!")

# Trying to remove a student
remove_student("Tom")  # Tom has been removed.
remove_student("Sam")  # Sam is not in the list!
```

## ✅ Conclusion

Today, we learned about list operations and exception handling in Python through real-time examples. These are essential skills for any Python programmer. Keep practicing and experimenting with different scenarios! 🎉
